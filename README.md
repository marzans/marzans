Hi, I'm Salwa Marzan and I'm trying to showcase some current post-college projects and works in progress. 
I'm going to be updating this from time to time but for right now it's very fresh and I'm putting any kind
of content on here that may be remotely helpful in showcasing my skills and abilities. 
As time goes on, I hope to have more relevant content available on this page. 

Thank you for visiting!
